# I modified Andrew Brooks' code to handle transaction data. The sample transaction data is given in Excel file. I ran following code without any issue in a R version
# of MS SQL - R Server. When I tried to test on a different machine I ran into some problems. 
# So, I advice that you install most recent version of R, Rstudio and RTools on your machine. You need to compile package rlang in order to run package devtools properly.
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pkg_install("r-lib/rlang")
# install rlang package by above two lines. But make sure that you properly installed RTools for Windows first. 
# Then install package devtools by
# install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)
# after that you can install other necessary packages before running the content of file "Run_arulesInterfaceXL.R". After they are all installed, you can just highlight 
# (select all lines) the content of file "Run_arulesInterfaceXL.R" and run the selected files.
